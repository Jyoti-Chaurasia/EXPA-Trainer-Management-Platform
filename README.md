# **EXPA Trainer Management Platform**

This platform was developed by my team during **Code For Good Bengaluru '24** for the **Exchange Participants Association of India (NCC EXPA)**. Our solution streamlines the assignment of trainers to training camps and optimizes travel planning, reducing the operational workload of the EXPA team.

The platform automates the selection of eligible trainers for the nearest camps, ensures optimal travel arrangements, and facilitates smooth approval workflows for admins.
